# C-Codereview-101

This repository contains several C programs focused on practicing basic data structures and algorithms, such as contact lists and search operations. These projects help build foundational skills in C programming, including use of typedef, arrays, and string manipulation.

Projects Included
1. contactlist.c

Implements a contact list using typedef structs to store names and phone numbers.

Demonstrates struct usage, arrays, and basic input/output.

2. contactsearch.c

Searches for a contact name within a list.

Shows string comparison and command-line argument handling.

3. linearsearch.c

Simple linear search implementation for command-line argument input.

Demonstrates basic loop and conditional logic.

4. namesearch.c

Another variation of name search functionality.

Focus on string comparison and input validation.
